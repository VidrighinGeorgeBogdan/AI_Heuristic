 It is given a  k x k  grid that is configured with a pattern of walls. You are required to place n archers on this grid such that they cannot shoot each other. An archer can shoot up, down, left, right and also diagonally and its shoot can reach at most w locations in all directions, up to the grid edges.

 For this problem the obvious choice was a backtracking approach but given the requirement to use a heuristic search algorithm, my choice was hill climbing.
